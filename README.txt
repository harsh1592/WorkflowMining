DUTCH HOSPITAL LOG WORKFLOW MINING
===================================
Steps performed:
1. Install ProM tool.
2. Download the filtered XES M16_821.xes and upload to ProM.
3. Generate the Fuzzy Model applying the Fuzzy Miner algorithm.
4. Generate the workflow model using the Alpha Miner algorithm and export it in the form of PNML format.
5. Run the java code findDecisionPoints.java after compiling on the PNML file to get the decision points.
6. Run the dataExtract.java file to extract the data corresponding to the decision point and save in the file.
7. Pass the processed csv file WFM_data_extracted and processed.csv  to Weka and run J48(Decision Tree) algorithm on it.

Files attached:
----------------
1. Hospital_log.xes : original data log generated by the billing machine
2. M16_821.xes : filtered and preprocessed log for the ovary cancer patients.
3. pnml_m16_821.pnml : PNML file corresponding to the workflow model generated by alpha miner.
4. findDecisionPoints.java : to explore the decision points from the PNML file.
5. processData.java : to remove the consecutive occurances of the event with the same org:group
6. dataExtract.java: to extract the data and save in the file corresponding to a decision point.
7. General Lab Clinical Chemistry.txt and General Lab Clinical Chemistry_nextClass.txt : extracted data and target variable
8. WFM_data_extracted and processed.csv : preprocessed file for making the decision model.
